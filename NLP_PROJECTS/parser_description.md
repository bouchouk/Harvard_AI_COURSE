# Sentence Parsing Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Sentence Parsing Project! This project focuses on enhancing natural language understanding by employing context-free grammar to parse English sentences. The goal is to determine the grammatical structure of sentences and extract key components, such as noun phrases, to gain insights into the subject matter.

## How it Works

The project follows the principles of context-free grammar formalism, applying rewriting rules to transform nonterminal symbols into terminal symbols (words). For example, a rule like `S -> N V` indicates that a sentence (S) can be rewritten as a noun (N) followed by a verb (V). Combining rules allows the system to generate complete sentences.
