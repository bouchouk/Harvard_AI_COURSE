#Nim Game AI with Q-learning

This project focuses on implementing an AI for the game of Nim using Q-learning, a form of reinforcement learning. In Nim, players take turns removing objects from piles, aiming to force their opponent to remove the last object. The AI will learn optimal strategies by playing against itself, updating Q-values based on the outcomes of its actions
